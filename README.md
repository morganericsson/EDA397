# Agile Development Processes - lp4, vt2013

**Please note that there is not lecture on March 30 (since it's a holiday). Holidays are not my friend this time of year, so another change to the schedule (and not lecture on May 9 (Ascension Day)**

## Course Description
Software remains malleable, often illogical, and incomplete forever. *Sequential approaches* to software development, such as the *waterfall model*, assumes that it is possible to take every single variable that could affect a project into account beforehand. Considerable effort is spent to identify risks, plan mitigation, and what consequences these may have. From a traditional product perspective, this can be compared to creating an assembly line to produce software.

Given the nature of software, is it really feasible to identify all variables beforehand? *Iterative and incremental approaches* accepts that changes are inevitable and integrates change management into the development process. *Agile approaches* promotes iterative and incremental development by using a very tight *design-code-test* cycle. If we again use a traditional product perspective, this can be compared to new product development.

In this course you will teach you how to design and develop software, and to manage projects, using these agile principles:

- The customer is a part of the development team Incremental development 
- The developer should not be hindered by the process 
- Embrace changes 
- Continues refactoring (restructuring) of the design
 
After passing the course, you will be able to lead agile projects, work without a detail schedule, use test driven development, refactor programs, be part of a programming pair, and much more.

## Examination
The examination consists of three parts:

1. A **Software Development project** where you work in groups to develop an Android or iOS app using agile practices.

2. A  **[Post-mortem Report][PMR]** that outlines your experience with agile practices during the software development project. (individual)

3. A **Written exam**  based on the main course book, the papers listed in the table above and the material presented in lectures as well as on your project. 

To pass the course it is extremely important that you read all the course material, participate in lectures and are active in and finish your project. If you do not you will fail! Remember that this is a master level course and requires considerably more than most bachelor level courses.

Your final grade will be set according to the [Grading Policy][GP]
